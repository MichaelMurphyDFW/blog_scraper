# blog_scraper
Coding project - This scraper scrubs through the rithmschool.com blog (with permission as part of a Python course) using BeautifulSoup, collecting each blog title, publish date, and URL. At the end of each blog page, the scraper determines the URL of the next blog page, continuing until the last page is reached. The results are written to a csv file.
